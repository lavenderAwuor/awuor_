            <h2>Raising awareness on clean water use</h2>
            <p>As obvious as it is, all humans deserve to drink clean water however, due to environmental or natural circumstances it poses a threat to the community. </p>

        <section id="HIV/AIDS awareness">
            <h2>Raising HIV/AIDS awareness among widows</h2>
            <p>HIV/AIDS is as common as it was ten years ago however, over the years it has become more widepread and many people are more knowledgable. </p>
            <p>Reducing stigma and discrimination of people infected with HIV can make improvements in the lives of those infected / sick.</p>

            <h2>Promote economic empowerment among the widows</h2>
            <p>As women who have been widowed, it can pose as a struggle to find and attain financial stability and hence, this NGO aims at ensuring women have job to guarantee them a secure future.</p>

        <section id=" Offer Psychosocial Support to Widows">

            <p> It is our mission to help the widows in our organization with all the psychological help they require at their own individual levels.  </p>
            <p>By doing this, we are able to not only provide emotional support for the women, but allow them a smooth transition to society. This support looks like offering weekly counselling sessions to the widows on grief and counselling to assist them in  the five stages of bereavement.</p>        
        </section>

            By doing this, multitudes of women are able to live healthier and fulfilling lives.</p>
